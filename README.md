# Traffic detector data

Still undiscovered Vilnius traffic detector system raw data, with potential to make the user understand how traffic flows in this city. Now only a single day is parsed and shared here, for further testing purposes. As it is work in progress, expect some mess.

## What do we know?
* _DataTimestampUTC_ and _LOCAL_ is measurement time (obviously in UTC and in our local EET) 
* _C\_qKfz\_Wert_ is  misunderstood exotic _"expected value of a car count/hour"_ . So as we were told, detector logs _"an average"_ represented as a car count in a hour every 90s. We are not sure about that. Also _KFZ_ stands for "Kraftfahrzeug" (automobile). We are sure about that.


## Traffic detector locations

We are currently looking for any "lost" files to establish their location in a human way. 
At this moment we are stuck with [land-surveyor pdf's and jpg's](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xaaxstk0mvjcxb0/gLrgcH3-Dn?lst=).

It is possible to connect detectors with intersection names, and then find the appropriate land-survey pictures.
