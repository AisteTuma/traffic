# Traffic detector data

Still undiscovered Vilnius traffic detector system raw data, with potential to make the user understand how traffic flows in this city. Now only a single day is parsed and shared here, for further testing purposes. As it is work in progress, expect some mess.

## Traffic detector locations

We are currently looking for any "lost" files to establish their location in a human way. 
At this moment we are stuck with [land-surveyor pdf's and jpg's](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xaaxstk0mvjcxb0/gLrgcH3-Dn?lst=).

It is possible to connect detectors with intersection names, and then find the appropriate land-survey pictures.
